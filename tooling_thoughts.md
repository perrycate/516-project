# Ocaml

## Pros
+ Andrew is very familiar, Perry used to be.
+ Good tooling: Frama-C
    * Provides parsing and tons of functionality
    * We could potentially write our thing as a plugin and release it
    * https://frama-c.com/index.html
    * http://frama-c.com/download/frama-c-plugin-development-guide.pdf
+ Could use tools written by Kincaid (Duet)
    - Not well documented though
+ Due to tooling, more likely we can do analysis on real programs
## Cons
- Not as interesting to Andrew?


# Rust

## Pros
+ Andrew is extremely familiar
+ If we have time, could be fun to start hyperoptimizing
## Cons
- Perry doesn't know it
~ Tooling might not be as good as Ocaml (TODO)


# Elixir

## Pros
+ New language for Kincaid
+ Interesting to Perry
## Cons
- Perry hasn't written anything in it, Andrew doesn't know it
~ Tooling unclear (TODO iff there's a chance we use it)
    ~ If researching tooling, bear in mind that we could also use Erlang stuff
